NN - basic MLP 
    - designed to enhance my understanding of what is happening in a basic neural network. Used a book for the basic outline, then refactored it to be more general use.
    - started with a 3 layer network (input, hidden, output) using a sigmoid activation function
        -iterate on customizations( define number of hidden layers, different activation functions)
